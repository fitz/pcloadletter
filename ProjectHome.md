## What's this all about? ##

It's a 10-20 minute podcast where Ben and Fitz answer your questions about open source software development, collaborative software development tools, and the problems that inevitably arise when you try to write software with other people.  When they run out of questions to answer, they have a tendency to babble about a whole range of boring stuff, so keep those questions coming!

## Who the heck are you guys? ##

We're just these two guys, right?  We've been working together off and on for almost ten years now, and we also do a lot of "pair presenting."  Ben is one of the original founders of the Subversion project, and Fitz joined in shortly thereafter.  We're the first engineers that Google hired in Chicago, and between the two of us we have over 20 years of open source experience and more than 900 Google T-shirts, give or take a few hundred.
